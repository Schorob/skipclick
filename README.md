# SHSeg

This dataset contains masks for athletes that are currently skiing. I has been published alongside the following paper:

If you intend to use our dataset in your publication, please remember to cite our paper.

The dataset on its own only contains masks. The corresponding images are a subset of the SkiTB dataset published alongside the following two publications:

If you their images, please also cite their paper. You can download the images from [here](https://machinelearning.uniud.it/datasets/skitb/). 

 

The dataset itself can be downloaded from  [here](https://myweb.rz.uni-augsburg.de/~schoerob/datasets/shseg/SHSeg_masks_only.zip). The ZIP-file contains a file README.txt which contains further instructions on how to use the dataset.
